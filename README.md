# Capstone-Project
I worked closely with a cross-functional team to perform an in-depth SWOT and PESTEL analysis, evaluating the external and internal factors affecting the market of an oil and gas company. This comprehensive analysis helped us identify key opportunities, threats, strengths, and weaknesses in the industry, providing a solid foundation for decision-making. I was responsible for defining the project problem statement and playing a key role in developing the Project Charter and Scope Document. These documents outlined the projectâ€™s goals, objectives, and key deliverables. In collaboration with stakeholders, I facilitated the gathering of critical business requirements and analyzed potential solutions, making recommendations based on a thorough ROI analysis and risk assessment. This approach ensured that the proposed solutions aligned with both the business goals and risk tolerance of the company.
